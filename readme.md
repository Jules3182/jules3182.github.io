# Welcome to my personal website's code base
### If you're reading this then you're the best kind of nerd, I hope you enjoy and don't judge *too much* ;)

This is going to be very under construction for a little bit while I get things set up. In time this will become a *beautiful* home for my various endeavors and I hope eventually a hub for the not so faint heart of you to gather some of my resources.

## My Todo:
- [] Create all the pages
- [] Render a new background and make it Gruv af
- [] get a better font for the main text
- [] actually write a bio
- [] make a modal for the pgp pub key
- [] make mobile not awful
- [] spell check... ugh
