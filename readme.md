# Welcome to my personal website's code base
### If you're reading this then you're the best kind of nerd, I hope you enjoy and don't judge *too much* ;)

This is going to be very under construction for a little bit while I get things set up. In time this will become a *beautiful* home for my various endeavors and I hope eventually a hub for the not so faint heart of you to gather some of my resources.
